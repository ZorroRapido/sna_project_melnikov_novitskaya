       "'United Nations Headquarters New York, New York 10:17 A.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, and my fellow leaders, about a week ago I stood on the other side of the world in Vietnam on soil once bloody with war. And I met a small group of veterans, Americans and Vietnamese, who wit- — and I wa- — I watched an exchange of personal artifacts from that war — identification cards and a diary.\\xa0 It was deeply moving to see the reaction of the Vietnamese and American soldiers. A culmination of 50 years of hard work on both sides to address the painful legacies of war and to choose — to choose to work together toward peace and a better future. Nothing about that journey was inevitable.\\xa0 For decades, it would have been unthinkable for an American president to stand in Hanoi alongside a Vietnamese leader and announce a mutual commitment to the highest level of countries partnership.\\xa0 But it’s a powerful reminder that our history need not dictate our future. With a concerted leadership and careful effort, adversaries can become partners, overwhelming challenges can be resolved, and deep wounds can heal. So let us never forget that.\\xa0 When we choose to stand together and recognize the common hopes that bind all humanity, we hold our hands the power — in that power to bend that arc of history. My fellow leaders, we gather once more at an inflection point in world history with the eyes of the world upon all of you — all of us.\\xa0 As president of the United States, I understand the duty my country has to lead in this critical moment; to work with countries in every region linking them in common cause; to join together with partners who share a common vision of the future of the world, where our children do not go hungry and everyone has access quality healthcare, where workers are empowered and our environment is protected, where entrepreneurs and innovators everywhere can access opportunity everywhere, where conflicts are resolved peacefully and countries can chart their own course. The United States seeks a more secure, more prosperous, more equitable world for all people because we know our future is bound to yours.\\xa0 Let me repeat that again: We know our future is bound to yours. And no nation can meet the challenges of today alone. The generations who precede us — preceded us organized this body, the United Nations, and built international financial institutions and multilateral and regional bodies to help take on the challenges of their time. It isn’t always perfect — it wasn’t always perfect.\\xa0 But working together, the world made some remarkable and undeniable progress that improved the lives of all people.\\xa0 We avoided the renewal of global conflict while lifting more than 1 billion people — 1 billion people — out of extreme poverty. We together expanded access to education for millions of children. We saved tens of millions of lives that would have otherwise have been lost to preventable and treatable diseases like measles, malaria, tuberculosis. HIV/AIDS infections and deaths plummeted in no small part because of PEPFAR’s work in more than 55 countries, saving more than 25 million lives.\\xa0 It’s a profound testament to what we can achieve when we act together when we take on tough challenges and an admonition for us to urgently accelerate our progress so that no one is left behind, because too many people are being left behind.\\xa0 The institutions we built together at the end of the second world war are an enduring bedrock of our progress, and the United States is committed to sustaining them.\\xa0 And this year, we’re proud to rejoin UNESCO.\\xa0 But we also recognize that to meet the new challenges of our decades-old institutions and approaches, they must be updated to keep  peace  [pace] with the world. We have to bring in more leadership and capability that exists everywhere, especially from regions that have not — have not always been fully included.\\xa0 We have to grapple with the challenges that are more connected and more complex.\\xa0 And we have to make sure we are delivering for people everywhere, not just somewhere.\\xa0\\xa0 Everywhere. Simply put, the 21st century — 21st century results are badly needed — are needed to move us along.\\xa0 That starts with the United Nations — starts right here in this room. In my address to this body last year, I announced the United States would support expanding the Security Council, increasing the number of permanent and non-permanent members. The United States has undertaken serious consultation with many member states.\\xa0 And we’ll continue to do our part to push ref- — more reform efforts forward, look for points of common ground, and make progress in the year ahead.\\xa0 We need to be able to break the gridlock that too often stymies progress and blocks consensus on the Council.\\xa0 We need more voices and more perspectives at the table. The United Nations must continue to preserve peace, prevent conflict, and alleviate human suffering.\\xa0 And we embrace nations stepping up to lead in new ways and to seek new breakthroughs on hard issues. For example, on Haiti, the Caribbean Community is facilitating a dialogue among Haitian society. I think President Ruto of Kenya’s — I thank him for his willingness to serve as the lead nation of a U.N.-backed security support mission.\\xa0 I call on the Security Council to authorize this mission now.\\xa0 The people of Haiti cannot wait much longer. The United States is working across the board to make global institutions more responsive, more effective, and more inclusive. For example, we’ve taken significant steps to reform and scale up the World Bank, expanding its financing to low- and middle-income countries so it can help boost progress toward meeting the Sustainable Development Goals and better address interconnected challenges like climate change and fragility. Under the new president of the World Bank, change is already taking root.\\xa0 Last month, I asked the United States Congress for additional funds to expand World Bank financing by $25 billion.\\xa0 And at the G20, we rallied the major economies of the world to mobilize even more funding.\\xa0 Collectively, we can deliver a transformational boost to World Bank lending.\\xa0 And because the multilateral development banks are among the best tools we have for modern- — mobilizing transparent, high-quality investment in developing countries, reforming these institutions can be a game-changer. Similarly, we’ve proposed making sure developing countries have a strong voice and representation at the International Monetary Fund. We’re going to continue our efforts to reform the World Trade Organization and preserve competition, openness, transparency, and the rule of law while, at the same time, equipping it to better tackle modern-day imperatives, like driving the clean-energy transition, protecting workers, promoting inclusive and sustainable growth. And this month, we strengthened the G20 as a vital forum, welcoming the African Union as a permanent member. But upgrading and strengthening our institutions, that’s only half of the picture.\\xa0 We must also forge new partnerships, confront new challenges. Emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, hold both enormous potential and enormous peril.\\xa0 We need to be sure they are used as tools of opportunity, not as weapons of oppression. Together with leaders around the world, the United States is working to strengthen rules and policies so AI technologies are safe before they are released to the public; to make sure we govern this technology — not the other way around, having it govern us. And I’m committed to working through this institution and other international bodies and directly with leaders around the world, including our competitors, to ensure we harness the power of A- — artificial intelligence for good, while protecting our citizens from its most profound risk. It’s going to take all of us.\\xa0 I’ve been working at this for a while, as many of you have.\\xa0 It’s going to take all of us to get this right. In every region of the world, the United States is mobilizing strong alliances, versatile partnerships, common purpose, collective action to bring new approaches to our shared challenges. Here in the Western Hemisphere, we united 21 nations in support of the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection, launching a region-wide approach to a region-wide challenge to better uphold laws and protect — protect the rights of migrants. In the Indo-Pacific, we’ve elevated our Quad partnership with India, Japan, and Australia to deliver concrete progress for the people of the region on everything from vaccines to maritime security. Just yesterday, after two [years of] consultations and diplomacy, the United States brought together dozens of nations across four continents to establish a new Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation so that the coastal Atlantic countries can better cooperate on science, technology, environmental protection, and sustainable economic development. We’ve brought together nearly 100 countries in a global coalition to counter fentanyl and synthetic drugs to reduce the human cost of this affliction.\\xa0 And it is real. And as the nature of the terrorist threats evolve and the geography expands to new places, we’re working with our partners to bring capabilities to bear to disrupt plotting, degrade networks, and protect all of our people. Additionally, we convened the Summit for Democracy to strengthen democratic institutions, root out corruption, and reject political violence. And in this moment where democratically-elected governments have been toppled in quick succession in West and Central Africa, we’re reminded that this work is as urgent and important as ever. We stand with the Ac- — with the African Union and ECOWAS and other regional bodies to support constitutional rule.\\xa0 We will not retreat from the values that make us strong.\\xa0 We will defend democracy — our best tool to meet the challenges we face around the world.\\xa0 And we’re working to show how democracy can deliver in ways that matter to people’s lives. The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment addresses the enormous need and opportunity for infrastructure investment in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Through strategic, targeted public investments, we can unlock enormous amounts of private-sector financing. The G7 has pledged to work with parties to collectively mobilize $600 billion in infrastructure financing by 2027.\\xa0 The United States has already mobilized more than $30 billion to date. We’re creating a race to top with projects that have high standards for workers, the environment, and intellectual property, while avoiding the trap of unsustainable debt. We’re focusing on economic corridors that will max- — maximize the impact of our collective investment and deliver consequential results across multiple countries and multiple sectors. For example, the Lobito Corridor will extend across Africa from the western port of Angola to the DRC to Zambia, boosting regional connectivity and strengthening commerce and food security in Africa. Similarly, the groundbreaking effort we announced at the G20 connect India — to connect India to Europe through the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Israel will spur opportunities and investment across two continents. This is part of our effort to build a more sustainable, integrated Middle East.\\xa0 It demonstrates how Israel’s greater normalization and economic connection with its neighbors is delivering positive and practical impacts even as we continue to work tirelessly to support a just and lasting peace between Isr- — the Israelis and Palestinians — two states for two people. Now, let me be clear: None of these partnerships are about containing any country.\\xa0 They are about a positive vision for our shared future. When it comes to China, I want to be clear and consistent.\\xa0 We seek to responsibly manage the competition between our countries so it does not tip into conflict.\\xa0 I’ve said, “We are for de-risking, not decoupling with China.” We will push back on aggression and intimidation and defend the rules of the road, from freedom of navigation to overflight to a level economic playing field that have helped safeguard security and prosperity for decades. But we also stand ready to work together with China on issues where progress hinges on our common efforts.\\xa0 Nowhere is that more critical than accelerating the climate crisis — than the accelerating climate crisis.\\xa0 We see it everywhere: record-breaking heatwaves in the United States and China; wildfires ravaging North America and Southern Europe; a fifth year of drought in the Horn of Africa; tragic, tragic flooding in Libya — my heart goes out to the people of Libya — that has killed thousands — thousands of people. Together, these snapshots tell an urgent story of what awaits us if we fail to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and begin to climate-proof the world. For one day — for one day  [from day one], my administration, the United States, has treated this crisis as an existential threat from the moment we took office not only for us but for all of humanity. Last year, I signed into law in the United States the largest investment ever, anywhere in the history of the world to combat the climate crisis and help move the global economy toward a clean energy future. We’re also working with the Congress to quadruple our climate financing to help developing countries reach their climate goals and adapt to climate impacts. And this year, the world is on track to meet the climate fund — the cli- — the climate finance pledge that — made under the Paris Agreement: $100 billion to raise collectively.\\xa0 But we need more investment from the public and private sector alike, especially in places that have contributed so little to global emissions but face some of the worst effects of climate change, like the Pacific Islands. The United States is working directly with the Pacific Islands Forum to help these nations adapt and build resilience to climate impacts, even as we lead the effort to build innovative, new partnerships that attack the global challenges from all sides. From the First Movers Coalition, which is mobilizing billions of private-sector community — in the private-sector commitments to creating a market demand for green products in carbon-intense sectors like concrete, shipping, aviation, and trucking; to the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate, which is bringing farmers into the climate solution and making our food supply more resilient to climate shocks; and the Global Methane Pledge, now endorsed by more than 150 countries, which expands our focus beyond our carbon emission targets to reduce the potential greenhouse gases in our atmosphere by 30 percent in this decade: It’s all within our capacity. We need to bring the same commitment and urgency and ambition as we work together to meet the Sustainable Development Goals of 2030.\\xa0 These goals were adopted at the United Nations in 2015 as a roadmap for improving lives around the world. But the hard truth is: For decades of progress, the world has lost ground these past years in the wake of COVID-19, conflicts, and other crises.\\xa0 The United States is committing to doing its part to get us back on track.\\xa0 All told, in the first two years of my administration, the United States has invested more than $100 billion to drive development progress in bolstering food security, expanding access to education worldwide, strengthening healthcare systems, and fighting disease.\\xa0 And we’ve helped mobilize billions more in the private-sector investments. But to accelerate our forward progress on the Sustainable Development Goals, we all have to do more.\\xa0 We need to build new partnerships that change the way we tackle this challenge to unlock trillions of additional financing for development, drawing on all sources.\\xa0 We need to fill the gaps and address the failures of our existing system exposed by the pandemic. We need to ensure that women and girls benefit fully from our progress. We must also do more to grapple with the debt that holds back so many low- and middle-income countries.\\xa0 When nations are forced to service unsustainable debt payments over the needs of their own people, it makes it harder for them to invest in their own futures. And as we work together to recover from global shocks, the United States will also continue to be the largest single-community donor — country donor of humanitarian assistance at this moment of unparalleled need in the world. Folks, cooperation, partnership — these are the keys to progress on the challenges that affect us all and the baseline for responsible global leadership. We don’t — we don’t need to agree on everything to keep moving forward on issues like arms control — a cornerstone of international security. After more than 50 years of progress under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, Russia is shredding longstanding arms control agreements, including announcing the suspension of New START and withdrawing from the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty. I view it as irresponsible, and it makes the entire world less safe. The United States is going to continue to pursue good-faith efforts to reduce the threat of weapons of mass destruction and lead by example, no matter what else is happening in the world. This year, we’ve safely destroyed at least — the last chemical munitions in the U.S. stockpile, fulfilling our commitment toward a world free of chemical weapons. And we condemn the DPRK’s continued violations of U.N. Security Council Resolutions, but we are committed to diplomacy that would bring about the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. And we’re working with our partners to address Iran’s destabilizing activities that threaten regional and global security and remain steadfast in our commitment that Iran must never acquire a nuclear weapon. Now, even as we evolve our institutions and drive creative new partnerships, let me be clear:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Certain principles of our international system are sanc- — sacrosanct. Sovereignty, territorial integrity, human rights — these are the core tenets of the U.N. Charter, the pillars of peaceful relations among nations, without which we cannot achieve any of our goals. That has not changed, and that must not change. Yet, for the second year in a row, this gathering dedicated to peaceful resolution of conflicts is darkened by the shadow of war — an illegal war of conquest, brought without provocation by Russia against its neighbor, Ukraine. Like every nation in the world, the United States wants this war to end.\\xa0 No nation wants this war to end more than Ukraine. And we strongly support Ukraine in its efforts to bring about a diplomatic resolution that delivers just and lasting peace. But Russia alone — Russia alone bears responsibility for this war.\\xa0 Russia alone has the power to end this war immediately.\\xa0 And it is Russia alone that stands in the way of peace, because the — Russia’s price for peace is Ukraine’s capitulation, Ukraine’s territory, and Ukraine’s children. Russia believes that the world will grow weary and allow it to brutalize Ukraine without consequence.\\xa0 But I ask you this: If we abandon the core principles of the  United States  [U.N. Charter] to appease an aggressor, can any member state in this body feel confident that they are protected?\\xa0 If we allow Ukraine to be carved up, is the independence of any nation secure?\\xa0 I’d respectfully suggest the answer is no.\\xa0 We have to stand up to this naked aggression today and deter other would-be aggressors tomorrow. That’s why the United States, together with our allies and partners around the world, will continue to stand with the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their sovereignty and territorial integrity and their freedom.\\xa0 (Applause.) It’s not only an investment in Ukraine’s future, but in the future of every country that seeks a world governed by basic rules that apply equally to all nations and uphold the rights of every nation, no matter how big or how small: sovereignty, territorial integrity.\\xa0 They are the fixed foundations of this noble body, and universal human rights is its North Star.\\xa0 We cannot sacrifice either. Seventy-five years ago, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights captured a remarkable act of collective hope — and I say that again — collective hope — drafted by a committee representing different regions, faiths, philosophies, and adopted by the entire General Assembly.\\xa0 The rights contained in the declaration are elemental and enduring. And while we still struggle to uphold equal and inalienable rights of all, they remain ever steady and ever true. We cannot turn away from abuses, whether in Xinjiang, Tehran, Darfur, or anywhere else. We have to continue working to ensure that women and girls enjoy equal rights and equal participation in their societies.\\xa0 That Indigenous groups; racial, ethnic, religious minorities; people with disabilities do not have their potential stifled by systemic discrimination.\\xa0 That the LGBTQI+ people are not prosecuted or targeted with violence because of who they are. These rights are part of our shared humanity.\\xa0 When they’re absent — when they are absent anywhere, their loss is felt everywhere.\\xa0 They are essential to the advancement of human progress that brings us together. My fellow leaders, let me close with this.\\xa0 At this inflection point in history, we’re going to be judged by whether or not we live up to the promises we have made to ourselves, to each other, to the most vulnerable, and to all those who will inherit the world we create, because that’s what we’re doing. Will we find within ourselves the courage to do what must be done to preserve the planet, to protect human dignity, to provide opportunity for people everywhere, and to defend the tenets of the United Nations? There can be only one answer to that question: We must, and we will. The road ahead is long and difficult, but if we preserve –persevere and prevail, if we keep the faith in ourselves and show what’s possible. Let’s do this work together.\\xa0 Let’s deliver progress for everyone.\\xa0 Let’s bend the arc of history for the good of the world because it’s within our power to do it. Thank you for listening.\\xa0 You’re kind.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 10:44 A.M. EDT'"

      "United Nations Headquarters New York New York AM EDT THE PRESIDENT Mr President Mr SecretaryGeneral and my fellow leaders about a week ago I stood on the other side of the world in Vietnam on soil once bloody with war And I met a small group of veterans Americans and Vietnamese who wit and I wa I watched an exchange of personal artifacts from that war identification cards and a diary It was deeply moving to see the reaction of the Vietnamese and American soldiers A culmination of years of hard work on both sides to address the painful legacies of war and to choose to choose to work together toward peace and a better future Nothing about that journey was inevitable For decades it would have been unthinkable for an American president to stand in Hanoi alongside a Vietnamese leader and announce a mutual commitment to the highest level of countries partnership But its a powerful reminder that our history need not dictate our future With a concerted leadership and careful effort adversaries can become partners overwhelming challenges can be resolved and deep wounds can heal So let us never forget that When we choose to stand together and recognize the common hopes that bind all humanity we hold our hands the power in that power to bend that arc of history My fellow leaders we gather once more at an inflection point in world history with the eyes of the world upon all of you all of us As president of the United States I understand the duty my country has to lead in this critical moment to work with countries in every region linking them in common cause to join together with partners who share a common vision of the future of the world where our children do not go hungry and everyone has access quality healthcare where workers are empowered and our environment is protected where entrepreneurs and innovators everywhere can access opportunity everywhere where conflicts are resolved peacefully and countries can chart their own course The United States seeks a more secure more prosperous more equitable world for all people because we know our future is bound to yours Let me repeat that again We know our future is bound to yours And no nation can meet the challenges of today alone The generations who precede us preceded us organized this body the United Nations and built international financial institutions and multilateral and regional bodies to help take on the challenges of their time It isnt always perfect it wasnt always perfect But working together the world made some remarkable and undeniable progress that improved the lives of all people We avoided the renewal of global conflict while lifting more than billion people billion people out of extreme poverty We together expanded access to education for millions of children We saved tens of millions of lives that would have otherwise have been lost to preventable and treatable diseases like measles malaria tuberculosis HIVAIDS infections and deaths plummeted in no small part because of PEPFARs work in more than countries saving more than million lives Its a profound testament to what we can achieve when we act together when we take on tough challenges and an admonition for us to urgently accelerate our progress so that no one is left behind because too many people are being left behind The institutions we built together at the end of the second world war are an enduring bedrock of our progress and the United States is committed to sustaining them And this year were proud to rejoin UNESCO But we also recognize that to meet the new challenges of our decadesold institutions and approaches they must be updated to keep peace pace with the world We have to bring in more leadership and capability that exists everywhere especially from regions that have not have not always been fully included We have to grapple with the challenges that are more connected and more complex And we have to make sure we are delivering for people everywhere not just somewhere Everywhere Simply put the st century st century results are badly needed are needed to move us along That starts with the United Nations starts right here in this room In my address to this body last year I announced the United States would support expanding the Security Council increasing the number of permanent and nonpermanent members The United States has undertaken serious consultation with many member states And well continue to do our part to push ref more reform efforts forward look for points of common ground and make progress in the year ahead We need to be able to break the gridlock that too often stymies progress and blocks consensus on the Council We need more voices and more perspectives at the table The United Nations must continue to preserve peace prevent conflict and alleviate human suffering And we embrace nations stepping up to lead in new ways and to seek new breakthroughs on hard issues For example on Haiti the Caribbean Community is facilitating a dialogue among Haitian society I think President Ruto of Kenyas I thank him for his willingness to serve as the lead nation of a UNbacked security support mission I call on the Security Council to authorize this mission now The people of Haiti cannot wait much longer The United States is working across the board to make global institutions more responsive more effective and more inclusive For example weve taken significant steps to reform and scale up the World Bank expanding its financing to low and middleincome countries so it can help boost progress toward meeting the Sustainable Development Goals and better address interconnected challenges like climate change and fragility Under the new president of the World Bank change is already taking root Last month I asked the United States Congress for additional funds to expand World Bank financing by billion And at the G we rallied the major economies of the world to mobilize even more funding Collectively we can deliver a transformational boost to World Bank lending And because the multilateral development banks are among the best tools we have for modern mobilizing transparent highquality investment in developing countries reforming these institutions can be a gamechanger Similarly weve proposed making sure developing countries have a strong voice and representation at the International Monetary Fund Were going to continue our efforts to reform the World Trade Organization and preserve competition openness transparency and the rule of law while at the same time equipping it to better tackle modernday imperatives like driving the cleanenergy transition protecting workers promoting inclusive and sustainable growth And this month we strengthened the G as a vital forum welcoming the African Union as a permanent member But upgrading and strengthening our institutions thats only half of the picture We must also forge new partnerships confront new challenges Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence hold both enormous potential and enormous peril We need to be sure they are used as tools of opportunity not as weapons of oppression Together with leaders around the world the United States is working to strengthen rules and policies so AI technologies are safe before they are released to the public to make sure we govern this technology not the other way around having it govern us And Im committed to working through this institution and other international bodies and directly with leaders around the world including our competitors to ensure we harness the power of A artificial intelligence for good while protecting our citizens from its most profound risk Its going to take all of us Ive been working at this for a while as many of you have Its going to take all of us to get this right In every region of the world the United States is mobilizing strong alliances versatile partnerships common purpose collective action to bring new approaches to our shared challenges Here in the Western Hemisphere we united nations in support of the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection launching a regionwide approach to a regionwide challenge to better uphold laws and protect protect the rights of migrants In the IndoPacific weve elevated our Quad partnership with India Japan and Australia to deliver concrete progress for the people of the region on everything from vaccines to maritime security Just yesterday after two years of consultations and diplomacy the United States brought together dozens of nations across four continents to establish a new Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation so that the coastal Atlantic countries can better cooperate on science technology environmental protection and sustainable economic development Weve brought together nearly countries in a global coalition to counter fentanyl and synthetic drugs to reduce the human cost of this affliction And it is real And as the nature of the terrorist threats evolve and the geography expands to new places were working with our partners to bring capabilities to bear to disrupt plotting degrade networks and protect all of our people Additionally we convened the Summit for Democracy to strengthen democratic institutions root out corruption and reject political violence And in this moment where democraticallyelected governments have been toppled in quick succession in West and Central Africa were reminded that this work is as urgent and important as ever We stand with the Ac with the African Union and ECOWAS and other regional bodies to support constitutional rule We will not retreat from the values that make us strong We will defend democracy our best tool to meet the challenges we face around the world And were working to show how democracy can deliver in ways that matter to peoples lives The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment addresses the enormous need and opportunity for infrastructure investment in low and middleincome countries particularly in Africa Latin America and Southeast Asia Through strategic targeted public investments we can unlock enormous amounts of privatesector financing The G has pledged to work with parties to collectively mobilize billion in infrastructure financing by The United States has already mobilized more than billion to date Were creating a race to top with projects that have high standards for workers the environment and intellectual property while avoiding the trap of unsustainable debt Were focusing on economic corridors that will max maximize the impact of our collective investment and deliver consequential results across multiple countries and multiple sectors For example the Lobito Corridor will extend across Africa from the western port of Angola to the DRC to Zambia boosting regional connectivity and strengthening commerce and food security in Africa Similarly the groundbreaking effort we announced at the G connect India to connect India to Europe through the UAE Saudi Arabia Jordan and Israel will spur opportunities and investment across two continents This is part of our effort to build a more sustainable integrated Middle East It demonstrates how Israels greater normalization and economic connection with its neighbors is delivering positive and practical impacts even as we continue to work tirelessly to support a just and lasting peace between Isr the Israelis and Palestinians two states for two people Now let me be clear None of these partnerships are about containing any country They are about a positive vision for our shared future When it comes to China I want to be clear and consistent We seek to responsibly manage the competition between our countries so it does not tip into conflict Ive said We are for derisking not decoupling with China We will push back on aggression and intimidation and defend the rules of the road from freedom of navigation to overflight to a level economic playing field that have helped safeguard security and prosperity for decades But we also stand ready to work together with China on issues where progress hinges on our common efforts Nowhere is that more critical than accelerating the climate crisis than the accelerating climate crisis We see it everywhere recordbreaking heatwaves in the United States and China wildfires ravaging North America and Southern Europe a fifth year of drought in the Horn of Africa tragic tragic flooding in Libya my heart goes out to the people of Libya that has killed thousands thousands of people Together these snapshots tell an urgent story of what awaits us if we fail to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and begin to climateproof the world For one day for one day from day one my administration the United States has treated this crisis as an existential threat from the moment we took office not only for us but for all of humanity Last year I signed into law in the United States the largest investment ever anywhere in the history of the world to combat the climate crisis and help move the global economy toward a clean energy future Were also working with the Congress to quadruple our climate financing to help developing countries reach their climate goals and adapt to climate impacts And this year the world is on track to meet the climate fund the cli the climate finance pledge that made under the Paris Agreement billion to raise collectively But we need more investment from the public and private sector alike especially in places that have contributed so little to global emissions but face some of the worst effects of climate change like the Pacific Islands The United States is working directly with the Pacific Islands Forum to help these nations adapt and build resilience to climate impacts even as we lead the effort to build innovative new partnerships that attack the global challenges from all sides From the First Movers Coalition which is mobilizing billions of privatesector community in the privatesector commitments to creating a market demand for green products in carbonintense sectors like concrete shipping aviation and trucking to the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate which is bringing farmers into the climate solution and making our food supply more resilient to climate shocks and the Global Methane Pledge now endorsed by more than countries which expands our focus beyond our carbon emission targets to reduce the potential greenhouse gases in our atmosphere by percent in this decade Its all within our capacity We need to bring the same commitment and urgency and ambition as we work together to meet the Sustainable Development Goals of These goals were adopted at the United Nations in as a roadmap for improving lives around the world But the hard truth is For decades of progress the world has lost ground these past years in the wake of COVID conflicts and other crises The United States is committing to doing its part to get us back on track All told in the first two years of my administration the United States has invested more than billion to drive development progress in bolstering food security expanding access to education worldwide strengthening healthcare systems and fighting disease And weve helped mobilize billions more in the privatesector investments But to accelerate our forward progress on the Sustainable Development Goals we all have to do more We need to build new partnerships that change the way we tackle this challenge to unlock trillions of additional financing for development drawing on all sources We need to fill the gaps and address the failures of our existing system exposed by the pandemic We need to ensure that women and girls benefit fully from our progress We must also do more to grapple with the debt that holds back so many low and middleincome countries When nations are forced to service unsustainable debt payments over the needs of their own people it makes it harder for them to invest in their own futures And as we work together to recover from global shocks the United States will also continue to be the largest singlecommunity donor country donor of humanitarian assistance at this moment of unparalleled need in the world Folks cooperation partnership these are the keys to progress on the challenges that affect us all and the baseline for responsible global leadership We dont we dont need to agree on everything to keep moving forward on issues like arms control a cornerstone of international security After more than years of progress under the NonProliferation Treaty Russia is shredding longstanding arms control agreements including announcing the suspension of New START and withdrawing from the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty I view it as irresponsible and it makes the entire world less safe The United States is going to continue to pursue goodfaith efforts to reduce the threat of weapons of mass destruction and lead by example no matter what else is happening in the world This year weve safely destroyed at least the last chemical munitions in the US stockpile fulfilling our commitment toward a world free of chemical weapons And we condemn the DPRKs continued violations of UN Security Council Resolutions but we are committed to diplomacy that would bring about the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula And were working with our partners to address Irans destabilizing activities that threaten regional and global security and remain steadfast in our commitment that Iran must never acquire a nuclear weapon Now even as we evolve our institutions and drive creative new partnerships let me be clear Certain principles of our international system are sanc sacrosanct Sovereignty territorial integrity human rights these are the core tenets of the UN Charter the pillars of peaceful relations among nations without which we cannot achieve any of our goals That has not changed and that must not change Yet for the second year in a row this gathering dedicated to peaceful resolution of conflicts is darkened by the shadow of war an illegal war of conquest brought without provocation by Russia against its neighbor Ukraine Like every nation in the world the United States wants this war to end No nation wants this war to end more than Ukraine And we strongly support Ukraine in its efforts to bring about a diplomatic resolution that delivers just and lasting peace But Russia alone Russia alone bears responsibility for this war Russia alone has the power to end this war immediately And it is Russia alone that stands in the way of peace because the Russias price for peace is Ukraines capitulation Ukraines territory and Ukraines children Russia believes that the world will grow weary and allow it to brutalize Ukraine without consequence But I ask you this If we abandon the core principles of the United States UN Charter to appease an aggressor can any member state in this body feel confident that they are protected If we allow Ukraine to be carved up is the independence of any nation secure Id respectfully suggest the answer is no We have to stand up to this naked aggression today and deter other wouldbe aggressors tomorrow Thats why the United States together with our allies and partners around the world will continue to stand with the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their sovereignty and territorial integrity and their freedom Applause Its not only an investment in Ukraines future but in the future of every country that seeks a world governed by basic rules that apply equally to all nations and uphold the rights of every nation no matter how big or how small sovereignty territorial integrity They are the fixed foundations of this noble body and universal human rights is its North Star We cannot sacrifice either Seventyfive years ago the Universal Declaration of Human Rights captured a remarkable act of collective hope and I say that again collective hope drafted by a committee representing different regions faiths philosophies and adopted by the entire General Assembly The rights contained in the declaration are elemental and enduring And while we still struggle to uphold equal and inalienable rights of all they remain ever steady and ever true We cannot turn away from abuses whether in Xinjiang Tehran Darfur or anywhere else We have to continue working to ensure that women and girls enjoy equal rights and equal participation in their societies That Indigenous groups racial ethnic religious minorities people with disabilities do not have their potential stifled by systemic discrimination That the LGBTQI people are not prosecuted or targeted with violence because of who they are These rights are part of our shared humanity When theyre absent when they are absent anywhere their loss is felt everywhere They are essential to the advancement of human progress that brings us together My fellow leaders let me close with this At this inflection point in history were going to be judged by whether or not we live up to the promises we have made to ourselves to each other to the most vulnerable and to all those who will inherit the world we create because thats what were doing Will we find within ourselves the courage to do what must be done to preserve the planet to protect human dignity to provide opportunity for people everywhere and to defend the tenets of the United Nations There can be only one answer to that question We must and we will The road ahead is long and difficult but if we preserve persevere and prevail if we keep the faith in ourselves and show whats possible Lets do this work together Lets deliver progress for everyone Lets bend the arc of history for the good of the world because its within our power to do it Thank you for listening Youre kind Applause AM EDT South Court Auditorium Eisenhower Executive Office Building AM EDT PRESIDENT BIDEN Hello everyone Let me start by apologizing for the slight cold I have Thats the only thing thats happening to me these days Let me start by thanking everyone for participating in the second Summit of Democracies for Democracy I should say But more importantly thank you for the work youve put in over the last months to deliver on commitments you made to each other and to our peoples for the first Summit of from the first Summit of Democracy Look you know thats the power of these summits Not just to speak highminded words and shine a spotlight on those critical issues but to galvanize action that translate to concrete progress for people around the world Thats how we make democracy deliver for everyone And heres what I hope everyone gathered here and everyone watching around the world takes away from this summit Its working Its working You know when we gathered here in December of the sentiment in too many places around the world was that democracys best days were behind us Democracy had declined by some measures for consecutive years But this year we can say theres a different story to tell Thanks to the commitment thanks to the commitment of leaders of global gathered today and the persistence of people in every region of the world demanding their rights be respected and their voices being heard were seeing real indicatiors sic real indications that were at a were turning the tide here As I often say were at an inflection point in history here where the decisions we make today are going to affect the course of our world for the next several decades for certain Were going forward from this summit Our job is to keep building on our progress so we dont start heading in the wrong direction again to keep the momentum going This is a turning point for our world toward greater freedom greater dignity and greater democracy Here in the United States weve demonstrated that our democracy can still do big things and deliver important progress for working Americans Were bringing down the cost of essentials like prescription drugs and health insurance premiums Were giving families a little bit more as my dad used to say a little bit more breathing room Were rebuilding Americas infrastructure driving innovation and tackling the climate crisis while all while creating good union jobs and investing in communities that too often have been left behind in the past Were also demonstrating the resilience of American democracy During our free fair and secure elections last fall Americas first national election since the January th attack on our Capitol Capitol voters resoundingly and roundly rejected the voices of extremism attacking and undermining our democracy The right to vote to have your vote counted is the threshold of democracy and liberty everywhere in the world And with it anything is possible Without it in my view nothing is possible Thats why earlier this year I was proud to sign the bipartisan Electoral Count Reform Act to ensure American elections continue to reflect the will of the American people and protect the peaceful transfer of power You know were going to keep working to further strengthen protections by working to pass what we call the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act Theyre just to further strength our democracy And its not just the United States thats thats delivering on our commitment and demonstrating power the power of democracy Angola Angola has taken steps to build an independent judiciary creating three new region three new regional courts of appeal which are going to help process cases more quickly The the Dominican Republic has modernized its anticorruption law to create more than anticorruption offices at local levels Croatia is implementing a multiyear anticorruption plan to increase government transparency and better oversee public procurement And there are many more examples I could give but Im not going to take the time in many other countries for every person from countries taking the first steps toward reform to wellestablished democracies of people making real changes to protect and strengthen their democracy Look all we know its not easy Its not this has never been easy Democracy is hard work The work of democracy is never finished Its never laid down and thats it all you have to do It must be protected constantly We have to continually renew our commitment continually strengthen our institutions root out corruption where we find it seek to build consensus and reject political violence give hate and extremism no safe harbor We have to continue our efforts to advance the rights and dignity and I emphasize the word dignity of all people including women and girls you know because wherever women and girls are under threat democracy peace and stability are at risk as well And we cant achieve our goals if were leaving more than half the worlds population out of the solution We just heard from two incredible women who made an incredible case about regarding Belarus They are theyre not only women theyre leaders They deserve and all women deserve to be represented Moreover when we advance eq equality and racial justice and invest in young people protect the LGBTQ individuals our societies are not only fairer but theyre stronger and more successful Democracy demands full and equal participation of all all of our citizens Thats how we unleash the human potential and put ourselves in the strongest possible position to take on the shared challenges and I emphasize shared challenges And when democracies stand together we reinforce and amplify each others efforts to great effect And weve seen it over and over again democracies stepping up to lead and to solve problems together not just for our own people but for the world From our work to coordinate a global response to the COVID pandemic to strengthen global health security so we have be were better prepared to prevent and respond to future global health threats to our commitment to raise our ambitions on climate goals that we have to preserve our planet literally preserve our planet for future generations to making sure parents can feed their children strengthening food security by building more sustainable and resilient food systems around the globe and to the unprecedented unity the unprecedented unity weve seen from democracies condemning Russias brutal war of aggression against Ukraine and standing in solidarity with the brave Ukrainian people as they defend their democracy So today the United States is building on our enduring commitment to boost democracy globally At the first Summit of Democracy I launched the Presidential Initiative for Democratic Renewal committed more than million to shore up transparent and accountable governance support for media freedom to fight for international fighting international corruption stand with democracy and democratic reformers promote technology that advances democracy defend elections Now working in close cooperation with the United States Congress we plan to add another million for new funding for the Presidential Initiative over the next two years And over the course of three years my administration intends to work with Congress to commit billion across all our efforts to advance democracy around the world Were all safer when that occurs Were creating a new Bureau for of Democracy Human Rights and Governance at USAID to implement many of these funding commitments to enhance our support for democratic initiatives globally You know one key focus of our democ of our democracy work will be on making sure that technologies can continue to develop continue to develop that are used to advance democratic governance not used to undermine it As part of this earlier this week I signed an executive order here in the United States to restrict the US governments use of commercial spyware that has been abused to target dissidents activists and journalists around the world including in the United States US taxpayer dollars should not should not support companies that are willing to sell their products to abate sic human rights and violations excuse me abet human rights violations And I want to thank those countries who are joining us this week in committing to regulate the use of commercial spyware This effort is one of many many my administration is leading in the digital space for strengthening tools for Internet freedom to better protecting activists and journalists from cyber threats harassment abuse and and shaping emergency sic emerging technologies like artificial intelligence so that they deliver and develop things that are in line with our values our values And as you can probably tell strengthening democracy is a subject about which I am somewhat passionate I believe this is a defining challenge of our age And today we can say with pride that the democracies of the world are getting stronger not weaker Autocracies of the world are getting weaker not stronger Thats a direct result of all of us all of us coming together with confidence in ourselves and conviction in our cause governments from around the globe representatives of civil society and business democratic activists and trade unionist people who refuse to stand silent at attempts to erode their rights All all of us are making the choice to be leaders of our world and what our world needs to make democracies stronger to keep the torch of liberty burning for ourselves and generations to come We have to keep going and we will Thanks to the Republic of Korea for stepping forward to host the next Summit for Democracies And well sustain this forum as a driver of progress for progress and an anchor for our commitment to one another So thank you all again for participating I look forward to all of you each one of you to hearing from you And I know Im now going to turn turn this over to the President of Slovakia Madam President its all yours Participating leaders begin remarks Participating leaders conclude remarks PRESIDENT BIDEN Well thank you Mr President for your last comments I agree with you completely Let me just close by thanking all of you again for making a priority for your country and for the world more democracy You know were covering a lot of ground in these sessions today on all ways democracy can is at at the heart of all that we hope to achieve and for our people spurring economic growth shared prosperity unfolding justice and upholding it as well strengthening our institutions taking global challenges tackling them head on advancing inclusion and equity for all our people The great strength of democracy is that it gives us all the tools we need for selfgovernment and selfimprovement And Im proud to stand with all of you to defend those fundamental values we all share justice the rule of law free speech assembly freedom of the press freedom of religion and our core belief in the interest of human rights for every single individual in the world You know weve accomplished a great deal together but we all know how much work lies ahead Weve proven were up to the challenge But with the Republic of Korea hosting the next Summit of Democracy were going to keep going together all of us So I thank you all very much I wont take any more of your time But Ive been impressed by what youve had to say Thank you all very very much PM EDT PM EDT THE PRESIDENT Good evening my fellow Americans Were facing an inflection point in history one of those moments where the decisions we make today are going to determine the future for decades to come Thats what Id like to talk with you about tonight You know earlier this morning I returned from Israel They tell me Im the first American president to travel there during a war I met with the Prime Minister and members of his cabinet And most movingly I met with Israelis who had personally lived through horrific horror of the attack by Hamas on the th of October More than people slaughtered in Israel including at least American citizens Scores of innocents from infants to elderly grandparents Israelis Americans taken hostage As I told the families of Americans being held captive by Hamas were pursuing every avenue to bring their loved ones home As President there is no higher priority for me than the safety of Americans held hostage The terrorist group Hamas unleashed pure unadulterated evil in the world But sadly the Jewish people know perhaps better than anyone that there is no limit to the depravity of people when they want to inflict pain on others In Israel I saw a people who are strong determined resilient and also angry in shock and in deep deep pain I also spoke with President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority and reiterated that the United States remains committed to the Palestinian peoples right to dignity and to selfdetermination The actions of Hamas terrorists dont take that right away Like so many other I am heartbroken by the tragic loss of Palestinian life including the explosion at a hospital in Gaza which was not done by the Israelis We mourn every innocent life lost We cant ignore the humanity of innocent Palestinians who only want to live in peace and have an opportunity You know the assault on Israel echoes nearly months of war tragedy and brutality inflicted on the people of Ukraine people that were very badly hurt since Putin launched his allout invasion Weve have not forgotten the mass graves the bodies found bearing signs of torture rape used as a weapon by the Russians and thousands and thousands of Ukrainian children forcibly taken into Russia stolen from their parents Its sick Hamas and Putin represent different threats but they share this in common They both want to completely annihilate a neighboring democracy completely annihilate it Hamas its stated purpose for existing is the destruction of the State of Israel and the murder of Jewish people Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people Hamas uses Palestinian civilians as human shields and innocent Palestinian families are suffering greatly because of them Meanwhile Putin denies Ukraine has or ever had real statehood He claims the Soviet Union created Ukraine And just two weeks ago he told the world that if the United States and our allies withdraw and if the United States withdraw our allies will as well military support for Ukraine it would have quote a week left to live But were not withdrawing I know these conflicts can seem far away And its natural to ask Why does this matter to America So let me share with you why making sure Israel and Ukraine succeed is vital for Americas national security You know history has taught us that when terrorists dont pay a price for their terror when dictators dont pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos and death and more destruction They keep going and the cost and the threats to America and to the world keep rising So if we dont stop Putins appetite for power and control in Ukraine he wont limit himself just to Ukraine Hes Putin has already threated to remind quote remind Poland that their western land was a gift from Russia One of his top advisors a former president of Russia has called Estonia Latvia and Lithuania Russias Baltic provinces These are all NATO Allies For years NATO has kept peace in Europe and has been the cornerstone of American security And if Putin attacks a NATO Ally we will defend every inch of NATO which the treaty requires and calls for We will have something that we do not seek make it clear we do not seek we do not seek to have American troops fighting in Russia or fighting against Russia Beyond Europe we know that our allies and maybe most importantly our adversaries and competitors are watching Theyre watching our response in Ukraine as well And if we walk away and let Putin erase Ukraines independence wouldbe aggressors around the world would be emboldened to try the same The risk of conflict and chaos could spread in other parts of the world in the IndoPacific in the Middle East especially in the Middle East Iran is is supporting Russias U in Ukraine and its supporting Hamas and other terrorist groups in the region And well continue to hold them accountable I might add The United States and our partners across the region are working to build a better future for the Middle East one where the Middle East is more stable better connected to its neighbors and through innovative projects like the IndiaMiddle EastEurope rail corridor that I announced this year at the summit of the worlds biggest economies More predictable markets more employment less rage less grievances less war when connected It benefits the people it would benefit the people of the Middle East and it would benefit us American leadership is what holds the world together American alliances are what keep us America safe American values are what make us a partner that other nations want to work with To put all that at risk if we walk away from Ukraine if we turn our backs on Israel its just not worth it Thats why tomorrow Im going to send to Congress an urgent budget request to fund Americas national security needs to support our critical partners including Israel and Ukraine Its a smart investment thats going to pay dividends for American security for generations help us keep American troops out of harms way help us build a world that is safer more peaceful and more prosperous for our children and grandchildren In Israel we must make sure that they have what they need to protect their people today and always The security package Im sending to Congress and asking Congress to do is an unprecedented commitment to Israels security that will sharpen Israels qualitative military edge which weve committed to the qualitative military edge Were going to make sure Iron Dome continues to guard the skies over Israel Were going to make sure other hostile actors in the region know that Israel is stronger than ever and prevent this conflict from spreading Look at the same time President Prime Minister Netanyahu and I discussed again yesterday the critical need for Israel to operate by the laws of war That means protecting civilians in combat as best as they can The people of Gaza urgently need food water and medicine Yesterday in discussions with the leaders of Israel and Egypt I secured an agreement for the first shipment of humanitarian assistance from the United Nations to Palestinian civilians in Gaza If Hamas does not divert or steal this shipment these shipments were going to provide an opening for sustained delivery of lifesaving humanitarian assistance for the Palestinians And as I said in Israel As hard as it is we cannot give up on peace We cannot give up on a twostate solution Israel and Palestinians equally deserve to live in safety dignity and peace You know and here at home we have to be honest with ourselves In recent years too much hate has been given too much oxygen fueling racism a rise in antisemitism and Islamicphobia Islamophobia right here in America Its also intensified in the wake of recent events that led to the horrific threats and attacks that both shock us and break our hearts On October th terror attacks have triggered deep scars and terrible memories in the Jewish community Today Jewish families worried about being targeted in school wearing symbols of their faith walking down the street or going out about their daily lives You know I know many of you in the Muslim American community or the Arab American community the Palestinian American community and so many others are outraged and hurting saying to yourselves Here we go again with Islamophobia and distrust we saw after Just last week a mother was brutally stabbed a little boy here in the United States a little boy who had just turned six years old was murdered in their home outside of Chicago His name was Wadea Wadea a proud American a proud Palestinian American family We cant stand by and stand silent when this happens We must without equivocation denounce antisemitism We must also without equivocation denounce Islamophobia And to all of you hurting those of you who are hurting I want you to know I see you You belong And I want to say this to you Youre all America Youre all America This is in a moment where theres you know in moments like these when fear and suspicion anger and rage run hard that we have to work harder than ever to hold on to the values that make us who we are Were a nation of religious freedom freedom of expression We all have a right to debate and disagree without fear of being targeted at schools or workplaces or in our communities And we must renounce violence and vitriol see each other not as enemies but as but as fellow Americans When I was in Israel yesterday I said that when America experienced the hell of we felt enraged as well While we sought and got justice we made mistakes So I cautioned the government of Israel not to be blinded by rage And here in America let us not forget who we are We reject all forms all forms of hate whether against Muslims Jews or anyone Thats what great nations do and we are great nation On Ukraine Im asking Congress to make sure we can continue to send Ukraine the weapons they need to defend themselves and their country without interruption so Ukraine can stop Putins brutality in Ukraine They are succeeding When Putin invaded Ukraine he thought he would take Kyiv and all of Ukraine in a matter of days Well over a year later Putin has failed and he continues to fail Kyiv still stands because of the bravery of the Ukrainian people Ukraine has regained more than percent of the territory Russian troops once occupied backed by a USled coalition of more than countries around the world all doing its part to support Kyiv What would happen if we walked away We are the essential nation Meanwhile Putin has turned to Iran and North Korea to buy attack drones and ammunition to terrorize Ukrainian cities and people From the outset I have said I will not send American troops to fight in Ukraine All Ukraine is asking for is help for the weapons munitions the capacity the capability to push invading Russian forces off their land and the air defense systems to shoot down Russian missiles before they destroy Ukrainian cities And let me be clear about something We send Ukraine equipment sitting in our stockpiles And when we use the money allocated by Congress we use it to replenish our own stores our own stockpiles with new equipment equipment that defe that defends America and is made in America Patriot missiles for air defense batteries made in Arizona artillery shells manufactured in states across the country in Pennsylvania Ohio Texas and so much more You know just as in World War Two today patriotic American workers are building the arsenal of democracy and serving the cause of freedom Let me close with this Earlier this year I boarded Air Force One for a secret flight to Poland There I boarded a train with blackedout windows for a hour ride each way to Kyiv to stand with the people of Ukraine ahead of the oneyear anniversary of their brave fight against Putin Im told I was the first American president to enter a warzone not controlled by the United States military since President Lincoln With me was just a small group of security personnel and a few advisors But when I exited that train and met Zelenskyy President Zelenskyy I didnt feel alone I was bringing with me the idea of America the promise of America to the people who are today fighting for the same things we fought for years ago freedom independence selfdetermination And as I walked through Kyiv with President Zelenskyy with air raid sirens sounding in the distance I felt something Ive always believed more strongly than ever before America is a beacon to the world still Still We are as my friend Madeleine Albright said the indispensable nation Tonight there are innocent people all over the world who hope because of us who believe in a better life because of us who are desperate not be forgotten be by us and who are waiting for us But time is of the essence I know we have our divisions at home We have to get past them We cant let petty partisan angry politics get in the way of our responsibilities as a great nation We cannot and will not let terrorists like Hamas and tyrants like Putin win I refuse to let that happen In moments like these we have to remind we have to remember who we are We are the United States of America the United States of America And there is nothing nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together My fellow Americans thank you for your time May God bless you all And may God protect our troops PM EDT Presidential Palace Vilnius Lithuania AM EEST PRESIDENT NAUSDA In progress And first of all I would like to remind you that we are celebrating one and years of our establishment of our diplomatic relations Also our cooperation recently is improving all the time But I would like also to thank for the nonrecognition policy of the United States regarding the occupation of Lithuania in the Soviet Union It was very persistent policy It helped us our spirit moral spirit high And I think this is very important to remember too The situation in our region is unfortunately deteriorating And you see what is happening around us And we see Belarus just swallowed into the Russian Federation and we see that Belarus is becoming additional threat additional factor of insecurity in the region So this is the reason why we ask the NATO we ask our strongest Ally United States to pay a consistent atten attention to the security of our region And I think the NATO Summit which takes place in Vilnius in absolutely near proximity to adversary countries this is symbolic event symbolic But also at the same time this is a great opportunity to take the bold decisions and we expect that they will be done This is very important to mention that we already have this Vilnius meeting as historical one even before it started because the membership of Sweden is already the on the table And I think we will welcome the nd member of NATO very soon We have regional defense plans approved and now its important that they become executable by the end of this year with prepositioning with assigned forces We are probably Lithuania is one of the most enthusiastic supporters of transatlantic bond in Europe in European Union because we think that your participation your attention is extremely important in this field of geopolitical uncertainty And at the same time Lithuania is intending to buy to acquire military equipment from United States And I would like to mention Black Hawks Also we intend to buy HIMARS JLTVs Oshkosh And all this military equipment helps us to modernize our military forces At the same time we are closely cooperating with Germany And recently the very good decision was announced by Defense Minister Boris Pistorius to scale up the forward presence of eFP country Germany in Lithuania up to brigade size on a permanent basis So I think it would be very positive to welcome this decision and welcome the engagement of all eFP countries in the region to increase the forward presence in our in our region So Mr President thank you so much for your participation in our NATO Summit Im looking forward to closely cooperating with you and with our colleagues during these two days Im looking forward to to be able to listen to your speech tomorrow in Vilnius University It will be another historical moment for Lithuania And all the Lithuanian people greet you so warmly Even Vilnius you see its a little bit empty right now but this is because of security restrictions and some people decided to leave the city just to to avoid some inconveniences But you know in our hearts from bottom of our hearts we welcome your visit we welcome your arrival and we are looking forward to cooperate with United States in the future PRESIDENT BIDEN Well Mr President thank you for the welcome and thank your team as well You know its great to be back in Vilnius I was here in as vice president shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine the first time and at the time talked about what I thought Russia was likely to continue to do Some people were somewhat skeptical of my judgment at the time and but unfortunately it turned out to be accurate And the United States is here today to reaffirm our commitment to NATO but also to Vilnius Look we we go back a long way And the when we were committed to Lithuania and to the Baltics and to NATO I remember you may recall when we were having the debate in the United States Senate about enlarging NATO and I was arguing very strongly that the Baltics should all be a part of NATO And youve been very very added value And our pledge to be with you has not wavered It didnt take us long to get thousands of troops here when Russia invaded the second time Well be able to you can be assured that youre going to have all that you need We have the Secretary of Defense with us today We can send him alone hes enough Laughter But but all kidding aside we And look as Ive said before We take NATO takes all of us take Article literally One inch of NATO territory means were all were all in a war together against whomever is violating that space and were going to defend every inch of it And I want to thank you Mr President for hosting this historic summit at an important time the first time that NATO leaders will meet with together and looking forward to meeting very soon with members with the addition of Sweden The leader of Sweden was just in my Oval Office not long ago and we were hoping this would occur when it did And Im confident well get that done today And in the coming days were also going to discuss a range of issues how to strengthen NATOs eastern flank and modernize NATOs deterrence and defense capabilities And were going to be doing it in a place of where those those efforts truly matter every single solitary day And were also going to discuss our support for the people of Ukraine And I want to thank you and for your partnership and leadership as we take on this challenge together So I look forward to our conversation today and to continuing to stand with you and all the people of Lithuania for a simple reason shared values We have the same value set Its important Thats what NATO is all about Thats what transatlantic alliance is about And as you probably heard I am a very strong supporter of the transatlantic alliance Ive learned that nothing happens here that doesnt affect us So were all in Were looking forward to today Thank you PRESIDENT NAUSDA Thank you AM EEST THE PRESIDENT Hello Poland One of our great allies President Duda Prime Minister Mr Prime Minister Mr Mayor and to all the former ministers and presidents as well as mayors and Polish political leaders from all across the country Thank you for welcoming me back to Poland You know it was nearly one year ago nearly one year ago I spoke at the Royal Castle here in Warsaw just weeks after Vladimir Putin had unleashed his murderous assault on Ukraine The largest land war in Europe since World War Two had begun And the principles that had been the cornerstone of peace prosperity and stability on this planet for more than years were at risk of being shattered One year ago the world was bracing for the fall of Kyiv Well I have just come from a visit to Kyiv and I can report Kyiv stands strong Kyiv stands proud It stands tall And most important it stands free When Russia invaded it wasnt just Ukraine being tested The whole world faced a test for the ages Europe was being tested America was being tested NATO was being tested All democracies were being tested And the questions we faced were as simple as they were profound Would we respond or would we look the other way Would we be strong or would we be weak Would be we would would we be all of our allies would be united or divided One year later we know the answer We did respond We would be strong We would be united And the world would not look the other way We also faced fundamental questions about the commitment to the most basic of principles Would we stand up for the sovereignty of nations Would we stand up for the right of people to live free from naked aggression Would we stand up for democracy One year later we know the answers Yes we would stand up for sovereignty And we did Yes we would stand up for the right of people to live free from aggression And we did And we would stand up for democracy And we did And yesterday I had the honor to stand with President Zelenskyy in Kyiv to declare that we will keep standing up for these same things no matter what When President Putin ordered his tanks to roll into Ukraine he thought we would roll over He was wrong The Ukrainian people are too brave America Europe a coalition of nations from the Atlantic to the Pacific we were too unified Democracy was too strong Instead of an easy victory he perceived and predicted Putin left with burntout tanks and Russias forces in delay in disarray He thought hed get the Finlandization of NATO Instead he got the NATOization of Finland and Sweden He thought NATO would fracture and divide Instead NATO is more united and more unified than ever than ever before He thought he could weaponize energy to crack your resolve Europes resolve Instead were working together to end Europes dependence on Russian fossil fuels He thought autocrats like himself were tough and leaders of democracies were soft And then he met the iron will of America and the nations everywhere that refused to accept a world governed by fear and force He found himself at war with a nation led by a man whose courage would be forged in fire and steel President Zelenskyy President Putin President Putin is confronted with something today that he didnt think was possible a year ago The democracies of the world have grown stronger not weaker But the autocrats of the world have grown weaker not stronger Because in the moments of great upheaval and uncertainty that knowing what you stand for is most important and knowing who stands with you makes all the difference The people of Poland know that You know that In fact you know you know it better than anyone here in Poland Because thats what solidarity means Through partition and oppression when the beautiful city was destroyed after the Warsaw Uprising during decades under the iron fist of communist rule Poland endured because you stood together Thats how the brave leaders of the opposition and the people of Belarus continue to fight for their democracy Thats how the resolve of Moldovan people applause resolve of the people of Moldova to live in freedom gained them independence and put them on the path to EU membership President Sandu is here today Im not sure where she is But Im proud to stand with you and the freedomloving people of Moldova Give her a round of applause One year into this war Putin no longer doubts the strength of our coalition But he still doubts our conviction He doubts our staying power He doubts our continued support for Ukraine He doubts whether NATO can remain unified But there should be no doubt Our support for Ukraine will not waver NATO will not be divided and we will not tire President Putins craven lust for land and power will fail And the Ukrainian peoples love for their country will prevail Democracies of the world will stand guard over freedom today tomorrow and forever For thats what thats whats at stake here freedom Thats the message I carried to Kyiv yesterday directly to the people of Ukraine When President Zelenskyy said he came to the United States in December quote he said this struggle will define the world and what our children and grandchildren how they live and then their children and grandchildren He wasnt only speaking about the children and grandchildren of Ukraine He was speaking about all of our children and grandchildren Yours and mine Were seeing again today what the people of Poland and the people all across Europe saw for decades Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased They must be opposed Autocrats only understand one word No No No No you will not take my country No you will not take my freedom No you will not take my future And Ill repeat tonight what I said last year in this same place A dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never be able to erase the peoples love of liberty Brutality will never grind down the will of the free And Ukraine Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia Never For free people refuse to live in a world of hopelessness and darkness You know this has been an extraordinary year in every sense Extraordinary brutality from Russian forces and mercenaries They have committed depravities crimes against humanity without shame or compunction Theyve targeted civilians with death and destruction Used rape as a weapon of war Stolen Ukrainian children in an attempt to in an attempt to steal Ukraines future Bombed train stations maternity hospitals schools and orphanages No one no one can turn away their eyes from the atrocities Russia is committing against the Ukrainian people Its abhorrent Its abhorrent But extraordinarily as well has been the response of the Ukrainian people and the world One year after the bombs began to fall and Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine Ukraine is still independent and free From Kherson to Kharkiv Ukrainian fighters have reclaimed their land In more than percent of the territory Russia held last year the blue and the yellow flag of Ukraine proudly waves once again President Zelenskyy still leads a democratically elected government that represents the will of the Ukrainian people And the world has already voted multiple times including in the United Nations General Assembly to condemn Russias aggression and support a just peace Each time in the UN that vote has been overwhelming In October nations in the United Nations condemned Russias illegal annexation Only four four in the entire UN voted with Russia Four So tonight I speak once more to the people of Russia The United States and the nations of Europe do not seek to control or destroy Russia The West was not plotting to attack Russia as Putin said today And millions of Russian citizens who only want to live in peace with their neighbors are not the enemy This war was never a necessity its a tragedy President Putin chose this war Every day the war continues is his choice He could end the war with a word Its simple If Russia stopped invading Ukraine it would end the war If Ukraine stopped defending itself against Russia it would be the end of Ukraine Thats why together were making sure Ukraine can defend itself The United States has assembled a worldwide coalition of more than nations to get critical weapons and supplies to the brave Ukrainian fighters on the frontlines Air defense systems artillery ammunition tanks and armored vehicles The European Union and its member states have stepped up with unprecedented commitment to Ukraine not just in security assistance but economic and humanitarian refugee assistance and so much more To all of you here tonight Take a moment And Im serious when I say this Turn on and look turn around and look at one another Look at what youve done so far Poland is hosting more than million refugees from this war God bless you Polands generosity your willingness to open your hearts and your homes is extraordinary And the American people are united in our resolve as well All across my country in big cities and small towns Ukrainian flags fly from American homes Over the past year Democrats and Republicans in our United States Congress have come together to stand for freedom Thats who Americans are and thats what Americans do The world is also coming together to address the global fallout from President Putins war Putin tried to starve the world blocking the ports in the Black Sea to stop Ukraine from exporting its grain exacerbating the global food crisis that hit developing nations in Africa especially hard Instead the United States and the G and partners around the world answered the call with historic commitments to address the crisis and to bolster global food supplies And this week my wife Jill Biden is traveling to Africa to help bring attention to this critical issue Our commitment is to the people of Ukraine and the future of Ukraine a Ukraine thats free sovereign and democratic That was the dream of those who declared Ukraines independence more than years ago who led the Orange Revolution and the Revolution of Dignity who braved ice and fire on the Maidan and the Heavenly Hundred who died there and those who continue still to root out Kremlins efforts to corrupt coerce and control Its a dream for those Ukrainian patriots who have fought for years against Russias aggressions in the Donbas and the heroes who have given everything given their lives in the service of their beloved Ukraine I was honored to visit their memorial in Kyiv yesterday to pay tribute to the sacrifice of those who lost their lives standing alongside President Zelenskyy The United States and our partners stand with Ukraines teachers its hospital staff its emergency responders the workers in cities across Ukraine who are fighting to keep the power on in the face of Russias cruel bombardment We stand with the millions of refugees of this war who have found a welcome in Europe and the United States particularly here in Poland Ordinary people all across Europe did whatever they could to help and continue to do so Polish businesses civil society cultural leaders including the First Lady of Poland who is here tonight have led with the heart and determination showcasing all thats good about the human spirit Madam First Lady we love you Thank you all Ill never forget last year visiting with refugees from Ukraine who had just arrived in Warsaw seeing their faces exhausted and afraid holding their children so close worrying they might never see their fathers their husbands their brothers or sisters again In that darkest moment of their lives you the people of Poland offered them safety and light You embraced them You literally embraced them I watched I watched the looks on their faces Meanwhile together we have made sure that Russia is paying the price for its abuses We continue to maintain the largest sanctions regime ever imposed on any country in history And were going to announce more sanctions this week together with our partners Well hold accountable those who are responsible for this war And we will seek justice for the war crimes and crimes against humanity continuing to be committed by the Russians You know there is much for us to be proud of over the all that we have achieved together this past year But we have to be honest and clearedeyed as we look at the year ahead The defense of freedom is not the work of a day or of a year Its always difficult Its always important As Ukraine continues to defend itself against the Russian onslaught and launch counteroffensives of its own there will continue to be hard and very bitter days victories and tragedies But Ukraine is steeled for the fight ahead And the United States together with our Allies and partners are going to continue to have Ukraines back as it defends itself Next year I will host every member of NATO for our summit in the United States Together well celebrate the th anniversary of the strongest defensive alliance in the history of the world NATO And let there be no doubt the commitment of the United States to our NATO Alliance and Article is rock solid And every member of NATO knows it And Russia knows it as well An attack against one is an attack against all Its a sacred oath A sacred oath to defend every inch of NATO territory Over the past year the United States has come together with our Allies and partners in an extraordinary coalition to stand against Russian aggression But the work in front of us is not just what were against its about what were for What kind of world do we want to build We need to take the strength and capacity of this coalition and apply it to lifting up lifting up the lives of people everywhere improving health growing prosperity preserving the planet building peace and security treating everyone with dignity and respect Thats our responsibility The democracies of the world have to deliver it for our people As we gather tonight the world in my view is at an at an inflection point The decisions we make over the next five years or so are going to determine and shape our lives for decades to come Thats true for Americans Its true for the people of the world And while decisions are ours to make now the principles and the stakes are eternal A choice between chaos and stability Between building and destroying Between hope and fear Between democracy that lifts up the human spirit and the brutal hand of the dictator who crushes it Between nothing less than limitation and possibilities the kind of possibilities that come when people who live not in captivity but in freedom Freedom Freedom There is no sweeter word than freedom There is no nobler goal than freedom There is no higher aspiration than freedom Americans know that and you know it And all that we do now must be done so our children and grandchildren will know it as well Freedom The enemy of the tyrant and the hope of the brave and the truth of the ages Freedom Stand with us We will stand with you Let us move forward with faith and conviction and with an abiding commitment to be allies not of darkness but of light Not of oppression but of liberation Not of captivity but yes of freedom May God bless you all May God protect our troops And may God bless the heroes of Ukraine and all those who defend freedom around the world Thank you Poland Thank you thank you thank you for what youre doing God bless you all PM JST PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE Well good evening everyone Im very honored to be convening the third

morning Please have a seat Welcome to San Francisco Applause This Moscone Center is about as big as my state Laughter This is a city of synonymous with innovation and breaking barriers where collaboration and coming together have always been key to unlocking our potential Its a city that has been shaped by centuries of deep ties to the AsiaPacific region and by contributions of people of Asian and Pacific Island heritage So San Francisco is a natural place to gather to innovate and collaborate for the APEC Summit the CEO Summit and all the events were taking place this week And I want to to talk I want to thank everyone who has made this week possible especially those serving on APECs Executive Secretariat APEC Business Advisory Council the National Center for APEC and so many others Today APEC economies make up more than percent more than percent of the global GDP Were almost half the global trade The AsiaPacific is projected to be the largest contributor of global growth over the next years So the vision we pursue for the economic future of our region will rebound far beyond the AsiaPacific The choices we make are going to matter its not hyperbole to suggest for the entire world Its up to us to harness the dynamism of our economies and tap the entrepreneu entrepreneurial spirit of our people and unleash the potential the unlimited potential of our partnerships in order to realize a future that will benefit people not only in the AsiaPacific region but the whole world and I mean that sincerely people everywhere A future where our prosperity is shared and is inclusive where workers are empowered and their rights are respected where our economies are sustainable and resilient and the bridges that connect our people open a golden gate of opportunity to create lives of hope Just lives of hope Most people are just just hope You know thats been my approach here in the United States from the moment my administration took office Were building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up The trickledown economy worked okay sometimes but not a whole lot trickled down to my dads kitchen table But when the middle class does well the poor have a chance and the wealthy still do very well Because what happens the poor have a ladder up the middle class and the wealthy still do well Folks were already seeing the results The last quarter the American economy grew percent the highest growth rate in two years More people in the United States applause because of many of you sitting here the CEOs laughter lets give credit where its due more people in the United States are in the workforce today than at any time in American history Our unemployment has been under percent for straight months Inflation has come down by percent More to do We now have the lowest inflation of any the lowest inflation rate of any advanced economy in the world And meanwhile median household wealth has grown by percent in real terms since before the pandemic I acknowledge theres a disconnect between the numbers and how people feel about their place in the world right now and we can deal with the second part as well We still have work to do but our model for growing is delivering real results for all Americans significant Black unemployment Latino unemployment et cetera The strength of our economy is driving growth and spurring investment throughout our entire region and again because of many of you sitting in front of me made those judgements And its drawing investments to the United States especially from AsiaPacific economies Since the start of my administration companies from across the AsiaPacific have invested over billion in the United States These are historic investments creating literally tens of thousands of goodpaying jobs Were million created just since we came to office all across America in the industries that are going to shape the future of this globe semiconductors electric vehicles batteries critical materials hydrogen hubs and other critical and emerging technologies Ive long said Its never been a good bet to bet against the American people Never Applause No I mean it Think about it Its never been a good bet and were proving it once more So my message to all of you here today is Leaders of government and industry you can count on the United States Were delivering on our promises and were doubling down on our progress Well soon well soon be your strong and steady partner as we continue working together to realize the AsiaPacific region that is free and open prosperous and secure resilient and connected By the way twice since Ive been president Ive had the leaders of the AsiaPacific Islands come to meet with me in the United States Theyre all part of it I thought when I left the G and Vietnam desperately wanted to see me and raise the relationship it brought me back when I stood in front of that monument to John McCain all my days growing up I never thought that would ever occur Today Id like to talk a little about the work weve done in the region to get there and how were going to go about seeing this road forward Ive said for a long time The United States is a Pacific power I had that brief discussion yesterday with President Xi He asked why we so he had asked me before I reminded him why I we are so engaged in the Pacific Its because were a Pacific nation And because of us theres been peace and security in the region allowing you to grow He didnt disagree By the way it was a very good straightforward meeting We arent going anywhere For decades Americas enduring commitment to the region has been a springboard thats enabled growth transformative growth ensured the open flow of commerce and lifted millions of people out of poverty Today that relationship goes both ways The United States remains vital to the future of the region and the region is more vital than ever to the United States of America Thats been my administrations outlook from day one and we clearly laid out our approach with our IndoPacific Strategy We are delivering across the board including when it comes to our shared economic agenda The United States has deep ties with our fellow APEC economies More than percent of US exports go to fellow APEC economies Robust twoway investment between the United States and APEC countries supports good jobs and new opportunities all across the region And American businesses significantly represented here in this auditorium are the largest source of foreign direct investment into APEC economies In fact if we take just the US companies represented here at this summit and look at their new investments into APEC economies in the calendar year it totaled more than billion so far Investments announced today from co from companies like Amazon United Delta Microsoft to make sure our region is more inclusive and interconnected Investments announced today from companies like Boeing Apple Flexport and PepsiCola the Pepsi company I should say to make our economies greener and more sustainable Investments today from companies like IBM Organon Visa look they make up they make our region more resilient and ma you all make it more secure Here in this world this worldrenowned hub of innovation leading leading tech companies like Anthropic and Im going to mispronounce Im not going to even try Laughter Its better not to try and not mispronounce than try and mispronounce Laughter The point is Small and mediumsized businesses and startups are getting into action as well All of the announcements translate into real country real outcomes that matter to peoples lives Theyre proof that a strong dynamic American economy is an engine of growth economic growth and innovation throughout the entire region And theyre testament to the fact that American investment and American ingenuity are in high demand all across the region Because when you do business with the United States and our companies you know what youre getting high standards fair practices protections for workers worldclass ideas and innovation and a commitment to deal with the environment finally Its a quality guarantee Look this is how weve been able to mobilize billions in investment including major new announcements this morning through our Partnership for Global In Infrastructure and Investment We also worked closely to deepen our bilateral economic cooperation with partners throughout the region especially on the issues that will most impact our future economic success For example in September when I traveled to Vietnam as I mentioned earlier to mark a historic new phase in our partnership of our countries we committed to work together to strengthen the semiconductor supply chain With India Japan Republic of Korea and Singapore weve launched new initiatives to shape the technologies and standards that will transform the future Weve deepened economic partnership with the Philippines Indonesia Australia and others Weve renewed and elevated our engagement with critical regional bodies including ASEAN and the Pacific Islands Forum And when we and when we offered to host APEC two years ago we committed to modernizing this institution to make it easier for us to work together as we take on the challenges of a new era And there are many challenges Were going to see more changes in the next years than weve seen in the last years That brings me back to the summit and where we go from here The world is fundamentally different than it was years ago at the first annual APEC Leaders Meeting at Blake Island in Washington State The questions we must answer today are not about how much we trade but about how we build resilience lift up working people reduce carbon emissions and set up our economies to succeed over the long run How to deliver growth from the bottom up and the middle out so no one gets left behind And the idea behind this new IndoPacific Economic Framework a partnership among diverse and dynamic nations all committed to tackling urgent issues like pandemic response vulnerable supply chains climate change and natural disasters which we have learned can gravely impact our economies Weve announced the framework in May of And later today we are launching an important new tool to promote sustainable economic growth and create a race to the top not the bottom They are tangible commitments negotiated in record time that are going to deliver meaningful outcomes meaningful outcomes to make supply chains more resilient facilitate cleanenergy transition and fight corruption For example our new supply chain agreement will allow us to better monitor for supply chain challenges before they become the kind of fullscale disruptions we saw during the COVID pandemic and to ensure were better prepared to shift and adapt when disruptions do occur And they will I know you all know better than I our work is not yet done This framework will be a platform for ongoing economic cooperation And we will continue working to better facilitate highstandard trade that advances workers rights through strong enforcement of labor standards And every step at every step we have upheld our commitment to unions Each of the framework pillars includes strong prolabor outcomes that will benefit workers of all economies Its critical to building a stronger fairer more resilient economy for families across the IndoPacific This week my administration has launched our new Global Labor Strategy to ensure that workers rights are the centerpiece of our economic strategy internationally as well as domestically Thats a primary concern to me Last week in Illinois I congratulated the UAW on their record contract with the Big Three US auto companies The contract is going to lead to thousands of new jobs billions of dollars in plant investment to keep American auto industry strong and competitive And I urge any company investing in America to enter into partnerships with the most highly skilled dedicated and engaged workers anywhere in the world American labor And folks I asked the Treasury Department to do a study When labor does well what does that do to people all o all over nonlabor folks around the country Everyone benefits And by the way the reason many of you use labor is because theyre the best workers in the world Union Its not like you show up one day and say I want to be an electrician You show up one day and they say You got five years to practice And then you get a card Im also intent on responsibly managing the competition between the United States and the Peoples Republic of China Thats what we talked a little bit about yesterday President Xi and I Thats what the world expects of us And I promise you thats what were doing I met with Xi yesterday leader to leader to make sure there is no miscommunication between us As always and Ive met with him more than any other world leader because when I was Vice President it was concluded that I should get to know him It wasnt appropriate for the President of the United States to be meeting with the Vice President Weve had prior to this hours of private meetings just he and I each with a simultaneous interpreter Our discussions have always been candid and constructive I again emphasized to President Xi that the United States does not seek conflict And yesterday we announced resumption of militarytomilitary communication channels to reduce the risk of accidental miscalculation And it exists Applause This is not as my generation would say back in the day this is not all Kumbaya But its straightforward Its straightforward We have real differences with Beijing when it comes to maintaining fair and level economic playing field and protecting your intellectual property Were going to continue to address them with smart policies and strong diplomacy Weve also taken targeted action to protect our vital national security interest But let me be clear We are derisking and diversifying our econ economic relationship with the PRC not decoupling Not decoupling Well be firm in standing up for our values and our interests And I was very straightforward as he was with me yesterday At the same time on critical global issues such as climate AI counternarcotics where it makes sense to work together weve committed to work together Were going to continue our commitment to diplomacy to avoid surprises and prevent misunderstandings A stable relationship between the worlds two largest economies is not merely good for those two economies but for the world a stable relationship Its good for everyone Applause Let me close with this The Leaders Statement from that first Blake Island summit years ago captured a shared commitment to quote deepening the spirit of community end of quote among our economies For all that has changed over the past three decades we have to continue to summon the spirit of community to meet the challenges of today and to seize the enormous possibilities that exist My staff is tired of hearing me say this for the last I dont know how many years The world is at an inflection point where the decisions we make today this is not hyperbole are going to shape the direction of the world for decades to come for decades to come Just think of AI Thats particularly true in the AsiaPacific where so much of the future of our world will be written And I would argue each of us has a play has a part to play in writing that future together So today I challenge all of us to measure our successes not based on the bottom lines of our balance sheets but by the lives we lift up through our investments the potential we unleash with our innovation and the ability to continue to talk with one another Lets build a global economy where everyone has a chance to succeed and workers have a fair shot a fair share of the value they create The United States is stepping up because of many of you in this room Were not talking the talk were backing it up with commitments And were going to see us youre going to see us follow through So I want to thank you again for joining us in San Francisco thank you for your commitment to APEC and the future of the Pacific AsiaPacific region and thank you for everything youve already done to make this summit a success We can do more God bless you all Thank you Applause AM PST International ExhibitioncumConvention Centre New Delhi India PM IST THE PRESIDENT Well ladies and gentlemen thank you all My colleagues this is someone once said in a similar domestic action that was positive This is a big deal This is a real big deal And I want to thank you Mr Prime Minister One Earth One Family One Future Thats the focus of this G Summit And in many ways its also the focus of this partnership that were going to that were talking about today building sustainable resilient infrastructure making quality infrastructure investments and creating a better future a future of a greater thats represents greater opportunity dignity and prosperity for everyone Last year we came together as one to commit to this vision And this afternoon I want to highlight the key ways in which the United States and our partners are working to make this a reality Economic corridors youre going to hear that phrase more than once I expect over the next decade Economic corridors As we work to address infrastructure gaps across low and middleincome countries we need to maximize the impacts of our investments Thats why a few months ago I announced that the United States will work with our partners to invest in economic corridors In practice it means were focusing on regional infrastructure projects that deliver results across multiple countries and in multiple sectors And today Im proud to announce that weve finalized a historic agreement for a new IndiaMiddle EastEurope Economic Corridor As as a key part of this corridor were going to invest in ships and rail that extends the India that extends from India all the way to Europe connected by the UAE Saudi Arabia Jordan and Israel bridging ports across two continents unlocking endless opportunities including making it far easier to trade export clean energy expand access to reliable clean electricity lay cables that will connect communities that secure a stable Internet contributing a more stable more prosperous and integrated Middle East And I want to thank the sponsors And I particularly want to thank Prime Minister Modi and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin Salam sic Sa excuse me Mohammed bin Salman and President von der Leyen and the European Commissions And since his hes not speaking today I wanted to or maybe he is speaking today I had a note he wasnt speaking Any rate Im going to Im going to stop there In Saudi Ar the SubSaharan Africa were working in a privatepublic partnership as well to invest in a TransAfrican Corridor That includes a new partner the European Union President von der Leyen thank you for making this very possible Together as part of this corridor were going to invest in a new rail line that will extend from the western port in Angola to the the DRC to Zambia and ultimately the Indian Ocean Its a project thats about far from just laying tracks Its about creating jobs increasing trade strengthening the supply chains boosting connectivity laying foundations that will strengthen commerce and food security for people across multiple countries This is a gamechanging regional investment And the both of these are huge huge steps forward but theyre far from the only ones Were continuing to make big investments in infrastructure around the world That includes a solar energy site an insulin manufacturing facility an electricity project right here in India Were continuing to develop economic corridors across Africa Asia and the Americas And together with our partners were working to mobilize the trillions of investment needed to close the infrastructure gaps around the world including the formation of a new investor forum that the United States will host in a couple of weeks Let me close with this The world stands at an inflection point in history A point where decisions we make today are going to affect the course of our future our future all of our futures for decades to come A point where our investments are more critical than ever So together lets continue to work as one to seize this moment in history and max maximize our collective investments to find new partners to unlock new capital Because when we invest in low and middleincome countries all countries benefit When we invest in emerging economies all economies benefit And when we invest in the future of people anywhere people everywhere benefit So I want to thank you again for being here I look forward to working with all of you And Im going to turn it back to the prime minister Thank you Applause Event continues MODERATOR Thank you your Highnesses and your Excellencies for launching the landmark IndiaMiddle EastEurope Economic Corridor I would request all media and officials to remain seated and standing in their places while the leaders depart THE PRESIDENT Could I

want to say thank you thank you thank you I dont think wed be here without you Thank you Applause PM IST Point Loma Naval Base San Diego California PM PDT PRESIDENT BIDEN Well please if you have a seat please take it Its an honor honor to be here to welcome Prime Minister Albanese and Prime Minister Sunak And its my honor to welcome you both to the United States as we take the next critical step in advancing the Australia US UK partnership AUKUS Its an unusual name AUKUS but its a powerful entity You know when our countries first announced AUKUS months ago Im not at all sure that anyone would have believed that how much progress wed be able to make together and how quickly wed accomplish it And I want to thank the members of all our teams who helped bring us to this pivotal moment sitting here in front of us Thank you all very much Secretary Austin Secretary of the Navy Del Toro applause thanks for letting us come to your house Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Gilday where are you Admiral There you are And thank you for hosting us at Naval Base of Point Loma And I also want to thank Representative Joe Courtney founder of the bipartisan AUKUS working group and all the members of the Congress who are here today Thank you for being here You are applause a testament to the strong and and deep support for this partnership across the United States Australia and the United Kingdom are two of Americas most stalwart and capable allies Our common values and our shared vision for a more peaceful and prosperous future unite us all across the Atlantic and Pacific For more than a century weve stood together to defend freedom and strengthen democracy and to your and to spur greater opportunity in all our countries Ive always said when asked the United States is a Pacific power because were on the Pacific Ocean We are a Pacific power The United States has safeguarded stability in the IndoPacific for decades to the enormous benefits of nations throughout the region from ASEAN to Pacific Islanders to the Peoples Republic of China In fact our leadership in the Pacific has been a benefit to the entire world Weve kept the sea lanes and skies open and navigable for all Weve upheld basic rules of the road that fueled international commerce And our partnerships have helped underwrite incredible growth and innovation So today as we stand at the inflection point in history where the hard work of enhancing deterrence and promoting stability is going to affect the prospect of peace for decades to come the United States can ask for no better partners in the IndoPacific where so much of our shared future will be written In forging this new partnership were showing again how democracies can deliver our own security and prosperity and not just for us but for the entire world Today were announcing the steps to carry out our first project under AUKUS developing Australias conventionally armed nuclearpowered submarine capacity And I want to be clear I want to be clear to everyone from the outset right off the bat so theres no confusion or misunderstanding on this critical point These subs are powered not nucleararmed subs Theyre nuclearpowered not nucleararmed Australia is a proud nonnuclear weapons state and has committed to stay that way These boats will not have any nuclear weapons of any kind on them Each of us standing here today representing the United States Australia and Great Britain is deeply committed to strengthening the nuclear nonproliferation regime Weve undertaken this project working handinglove with the International Atomic Energy Agency and with Director General Grossi Australia will not produce the nuclear fuel needed for these submarines We have set the highest standards with the IAEA for verification and transparency and we will honor each of our countries international obligations Working together these past months weve developed a phased approach thats going to make sure Australian sailors are fully trained and prepared to safely operate this fleet so they can deliver this critical new capacity on the fastest fastest possible timetable Each of our nations is making concrete commitments to one another Were backing it up with significant investments to strengthen the industrial bases in each of our countries in order to build and support these boats By the way this partnership is going to mean an awful lot for goodpaying jobs for all workers in our countries including a lot of union jobs Theres a reason why not everyone has nuclearpowered submarines Nuclear propulsion is highly complicated technology that requires years of training to master So were starting right away Beginning this year Australian personnel will embed with US and UK crews on boats and at bases in our schools and our shipyards Well also begin to increase our port visits to Australia In fact as we speak the nuclearpowered sub the USS Asheville is making a port call in Perth as we speak And later this decade we will also be establishing a rotational presence of US and UK nuclearpowered subs in Australia to help develop the work force Australia is going to need to build and maintain its fleet One of the vessels you see behind me is a Virginiaclass nuclearpowered submarine the USS Missouri Topoftheline submarines are the vanguard of US naval power And excuse me for a point of personal privilege as they say in the United States Senate where Ive spent a lot of time these submarines hold a special place for the Bidens My wife Dr Jill Biden is the sponsor of the USS Delaware a Virginiaclass submarine and she never lets me forget it Laughter They feature cuttingedge propulsion technology provide unmatched stealth and maneuverability And with the support and approval of Congress beginning in the early s the United States will sell three Virginiaclass submarines to Australia with the potential to sell up to two more if needed jumpstarting their undersea capability a decade earlier than many predicted But the ultimate goal isnt just selling subs to Australia its developing something new together Were calling it the SSNAUKUS This new stateoftheart conventionally armed nuclearpowered submarine that will work that will combine US submarine UK submarine technology and design with American technology And I want to reiterate again The SSNAUKUS will not have nuclear weapons It will become a future standard for both the UK Royal Navy and the Royal Australian Navy It will meet Australias defense needs while bringing our militaries our scientists our engineers our shipbuilders our industrial workforce our countries closer together closer than ever Let me emphasize again Nuclear propulsion is tested and safe The United States and the UK have used it for nearly years from with a spotless record a spotless record Combined between the US and UK all of our nuclearpowered ships have traveled the entire globe around the entire globe more than million miles Thats going to the moon times Now we cant figure out how to get this sub to the moon but were le working on it Laughter No Ive got to admit our stewardship of naval nuclear propulsion technology is a point of honor pride and deep tradition currently helmed by Admiral Frank Caldwell who is here today Where are you Admiral Thank you Applause And the years of training were undertaking starting now will ensure that Australia is fully prepared to carry on this tradition and meet the highest possible standards of safety throughout the life of these boats Our unprecedented trilateral cooperation I believe is testament to the strength of the longstanding ties that unite us and to our shared commitment of ensuring the IndoPacific remains free and open prosperous and secure defined by opportunity for all a shared commitment to create a future rooted in our common values Thats the objective the United States shares not only with the UK and Australia Its shared by our friends in the region by our friends in ASEAN the Pacific Islands Forum and the Quad and our other treaty and close partners in the IndoPacific and Europe AUKUS has one overriding objective to enhance stability in the IndoPacific amid rapidly shifting global dynamics And this first project this first project is only the beginning More partnerships and more potential more peace and security in the region lies ahead Simply stated were putting ourselves in the strongest possible position to navigate the challenges of today and tomorrow together Together So I thank you again Prime Minister Albanese Mi Prime Minister Sunak And the United States could not ask for two better friends or partners to stand with as we work to create a safer more peaceful future for the people everywhere Im proud to be your shipmates Thank you Applause PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE Well President Biden Prime Minister Sunak I am so honored to stand alongside you both here overlooking the Pacific Ocean as leaders of true and trusted friends of my country of Australia Today a new chapter in the relationship between our nation the United States and the United Kingdom begins a friendship built on our shared values our commitment to democracy and our common vision for a peaceful and a prosperous future The AUKUS agreement we confirm here in San Diego represents the biggest single investment in Australias defense capability in all of our history strengthening Australias national security and stability in our region building a future made in Australia with record investments in skills jobs and infrastructure and delivering a superior defense capability into the future My government is determined to invest in our defense capability But were also determined to promote security by investing in our relationships across our region From early in the next decade Australia will take delivery of three US Virginiaclass nuclearpowered submarines This is the first time in years and only the second time in history that the United States has shared its nuclear propulsion technology And we thank you for it We are also proud to partner with the United Kingdom to construct the next generation submarine to be called SSNAUKUS a new conventionally armed nuclearpowered submarine based on a British design and incorporating cuttingedge Australian UK and US technologies This will be an Australian sovereign capability built by Australians commanded by the Royal Australian Navy and sustained by Australian workers in Australian shipyards with construction to begin this decade Australias proud record of leadership in the international nuclear nonproliferation regime will of course continue We will continue to adhere to all of our obligations under the nuclear NonProliferation Treaty and the Treaty of Rarotonga Our agreement unlocks a set of transformative opportunities for jobs and skills and research and innovation in Adelaide and in BarrowinFurness in Western Australia and here in the United States Opportunities that will shape and strengthen and grow Australias economy for decades and create around direct jobs for Australians from many trades and specializations engineers scientists technicians submariners administrators and tradespeople Good jobs with good wages working to ensure the stability and prosperity of our nations our region and indeed our world Our future security will be built and maintained not just by the courage and professionalism of our defense forces but by the hard work and knowhow of our scientists and engineers our technicians and programmers our electricians and welders For Australia this wholeofnation effort also presents a wholeofnation opportunity We will work with the state governments of South Australia and Western Australia to develop training programs that equip Australians with the skills they need to fill these jobs Working together our universities and research institutes will collaborate to train more Australians in nuclear engineering Were already sharing skills and knowledge and expertise across our borders lifting the capability and capacity of all three countries Already today Australians are upskilling on nuclear technology and stewardship alongside their British and American counterparts Already today there are Australian submariners undergoing nuclear power training in the United States And Im proud to confirm Mr President that they are all in the top percent of their class Laughter Built by innovation and extraordinary and emerging technologies these boats will present a unique opportunity for Australian companies to contribute not only to the construction and sustainment of Australias new submarines but to supply chains in America and in Britain The scale complexity and economic significance of this investment is akin to the creation of the Australian automotive industry in the postWorld War Two period And just as a vision of my predecessors Curtin and Chifley in creating our automotive industry lifted up our entire manufacturing sector this investment will be a catalyst for innovation and research breakthroughs that will reverberate right throughout the Australian economy and across every state and territory not just in one design element not just in one field but right across our advanced manufacturing and technology sectors creating jobs and growing businesses right around Australia inspiring and rewarding innovation and educating young Australians today for the opportunities of tomorrow Our AUKUS partnership is not just about the US and UK sharing their most advanced submarine capability with Australia although we do appreciate that Its also about building on the expertise within our three nations so that we can achieve things greater than the sum of our parts This is a genuine trilateral undertaking All three nations stand ready to contribute and all three nations stand ready to benefit I look out from here today and I see new frontiers in innovation to cross new breakthroughs in technology to achieve a new course for us to chart together Mr President Prime Minister for more than a century our brave citizens from our three countries have been part of a shared tradition of service in the cause of peace and sacrifice in the name of freedom We honor their memory today We always will While we respect and honor the past through AUKUS we turn ourselves to face the future Because what the United States the United Kingdom and Australia hold in common is more fundamental and more universal than our shared histories We are bound above all by our belief in a world where the sovereignty of every nation is respected and the inherent dignity of every individual is upheld where peace stability and security ensure greater prosperity and a greater measure of fairness for all and where all countries are able to act in their sovereign interests free from coercion Our historic AUKUS partnership speaks to our collective and ongoing determination to defend those values and secure that future today in the years ahead and for generations to come a journey that will strengthen the bonds between our nations as friends as peers as leaders We embark with great confidence in the capacity and creativity of our people with optimism in the power of what our partnership can achieve and with an unwavering conviction that whatever the challenges ahead the cause of peace and freedom that we share will prevail Thank you very much Applause PRIME MINISTER SUNAK Sixty years ago here in San Diego President Kennedy spoke of a higher purpose the maintenance of freedom peace and security Today we stand together united by that same purpose And recognizing that to fulfill it we must forge new kinds of relationships to meet new kinds of challenge just as we have always done In the last months the challenges we face have only grown Russias illegal invasion of Ukraine Chinas growing assertiveness the destabilizing behavior of Iran and North Korea all threaten to create a world defined by danger disorder and division Faced with this new reality it is more important than ever that we strengthen the resilience of our own countries Thats why the UK is today announcing a significant uplift in our defense budget Were providing an extra billion over the next two years immediately increasing our defense budget to around percent of GDP This will allow us to replenish our war stocks and modernize our nuclear enterprise delivering AUKUS and strengthening our deterrent And our highest priority is to continue providing military aid to Ukraine because their security is our security And we will go further to strengthen our resilience For the first time the United Kingdom will move away from our baseline commitment to spend percent of GDP on defense to a new ambition of percent putting beyond doubt that the United Kingdom is and will remain one of the worlds leading defense powers But ultimately the defense of our values depends as it always has on the quality of our relationships with others And those alliances will be strengthened through AUKUS the most significant multilateral defense partnership in generations AUKUS matches our enduring commitment to freedom and democracy with the most advanced military scientific and technological capability Nowhere is that clearer than in the plans were unveiling today for the new AUKUS submarine one of the most advanced nuclearpowered subs the world has ever known And those plans could not happen without cuttingedge American technology and expertise So I pay tribute to you Mr President for your leadership and to you Prime Minister for your vision of what AUKUS can achieve And for our part the UK comes to this with over years experience of running our own fleet Well provide the worldleading design and build the first of these new boats creating thousands of good wellpaid jobs in places like Barrow and Derby And we will share our knowledge and experience with Australian engineers so that they can build their own fleet Now our partnership is significant because not just are we building the submarines together they will also be truly interoperable The Royal Navy will operate the same submarines as the Australian Navy and we will both share components and parts with the US Navy Our submarine crews will train together patrol together and maintain their boats together They will communicate using the same terminology and the same equipment And through AUKUS we will raise our standards of nuclear nonproliferation This is a powerful partnership For the first time ever it will mean three fleets of submarines working together across both the Atlantic and Pacific keeping our oceans free open and prosperous for decades to come Joe Anthony we represent three allies who have stood shouldertoshoulder together for more than a century three peoples who have shed blood together in defense of our shared values and three democracies that are coming together again to fulfill that higher purpose of maintaining freedom peace and security now and for generations to come Thank you Applause PRESIDENT BIDEN With the permission of my colleagues I dont know that our friends can hear but the USS Missouri can you hear us AUDIENCE MEMBERS Hooyah Mighty Mo PRESIDENT BIDEN I see them all over there Theyre standing at attention Can I tell them At ease Im their CommanderinChief right I mean theyre laughter Anyway thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you You all are the best Youre the best And were going to be the best in the world the three of us Thank you all very very much Applause PM PDT Moscone Convention Center San Francisco California PM PST THE PRESIDENT Sorry to keep you waiting Its my fault Its my fault I was on the phone Hello everyone We just came from a please have a seat a threehour meeting with all APEC economies discussing how to generate more growth and more opportunity in the region particularly to deal with climate change Today were announcing progress on the important initiative that we proposed with of my colleagues here and of our of r APEC partners the IndoPacific Economic Framework Australia Brunei Fiji India Indonesia Japan South Korea Malaysia New Zealand the Philippines Singapore Thailand Vietnam and the United States In May of we came together in Tokyo to launch negotiations on this socalled framework We still have more work to do but weve made substantial progress In record time weve reached consensus on three of the pillars of the IPEF I hate acronyms I apologize Laughter The first we signed a firstofitskind supply chain agreement to help identify supply chain bottlenecks before they become the kind of disruptions we saw during the COVID pandemic We saw what happened then in the United States and elsewhere But the Unites States semiconductor supply chains dried up in Asia and the United States a lot of it shut down This is an agreement weve been in we put back in place We could if we had this agreement in place were talking about today we would not have had to lay off so many auto workers because lack of semiconductors and many other examples Second weve concluded an agreement to accelerate the clean energy transition in the IndoPacific region including by enabling greater US and private sector investment in clean energy innovation and infrastructure in our partner countries You heard discussions today about how theres many opportunities and ideas that have but being able to attract private sector investment and government investment is hard for many of these countries that have great ideas and great opportunities Well the solar investments in the Philippines is an example offshore wind in Thailand and Indon Indonesia joint investments between the United States and India on energy storage and so much more Third weve concluded an agreement to combat corruption and improve tax administration to make sure that our trade and investment is clean and transparent and private companies dont have any worry about their investments being used properly And thats exactly what weve done Every business leader Ive talked to and my colleagues have theyre more likely to invest in a region if theres less corruption more transparency And thats exactly what this agreement does and would show them But as Ive said we have more work to do We made progress in highstandard trade rules that include strong labor and environmental standards Weve committed to extending our cooperation to challenges like artificial intelligence energy security and semiconductors Were launching a critical minerals dialogue to further strengthen our supply chains and create clean energy jobs And today Im proud to announce that the United States is launching what well call the Investment Accelerator through our Partnership for the Global Infrastructure and Investment The Accelerator is going to bring private capital off the sidelines for major investments in clean energy and high technology Youve heard every one of my colleagues say one time or another that this cant be done without trillions of dollars of private sector investment to get hold of this and get ahold of it quickly to give them confidence to make those investments Thats going to create a pipeline of projects in partner countries and then match private sector financing with these projects And its going to give those private sector investors confidence that their investment will be made according to the highest standards Government investment is not enough We need to mobilize private investment And all the steps are going to help unlock this private investment and which is a necessary ingredient for success and rapid success in the area were talking about Put simply my colleagues and I are driving a race to the top among nations in the IndoPacific driving nations to the top on standards on transparency on inclusivity and innovation And together were going to be forging a better future one where workers get a fair shot and a fair share of the value they create where high standards and sustainable growth win out where we harness the full power and potential of our people We welcome other nations who share this vision for the future to join the of us Our economies will all be stronger because of it Now Id like to turn it over to a leader who has made part this partnership possible Prime Minister Kishida of Japan The floor is yours Mr Prime Minister Applause PM PST\n"
